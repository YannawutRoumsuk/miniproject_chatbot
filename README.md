## Overview
This project is a LINE Messaging API chatbot that recommends music, movies, or travel destinations based on user input. The bot interacts with users in a step-by-step conversational manner, maintaining user state between messages to guide them through choosing categories, countries, and subcategories (for music and movies) or seasons and countries (for travel).
